Design

Thing encapsulates every object in island.

Animal, Plant and Water are 3 subclasses under Thing.

Water has no subclass.
Plant has Grass as its only subclass.
Carnivore, Herbivore and Omnivore are 3 subclasses under Animal.

Cat belongs to Carnivore.
Rabbit & worm belong to Herbivore.
Kiwi, Sparrow, and Rodent belongs to Herbivore.

1. Draw Island, add in random animals, plants and water.
2. Move animals randomly through moveRandom method.
3. Move animals randomly & search for food method through tick & smellFood method in Animal.
	This includes smellFood method in subclass for individual animal's food profile.
4. Move animals randomly & search for water method through tick2 method in Animal.
5. Update to Rodent and Sparrow class to avoid Cat.
6. Add apple tree as a subclass under plant class. update world so apple tree size grow each turn.
